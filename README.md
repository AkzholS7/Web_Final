Great. Very good analogue to official university site. The site has a lot of information about news, events in university. But I suggest you to improve the design of site. Also I liked the registration form

Very convenient and well-developed site.  I really liked the design of the site, all the colors are worked out very well, without any unnecessary things.  everything works fine.  I think everything is perfectly done if we will compare it with our level of programming.  Nice work, I like it.
